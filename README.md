# Amazing Co's TreesShift

Modeling Amazing Company's structure, so we can do awesome stuff.

The company business units are modelled as a collection of directed acyclic graphs - or a forest of trees, if you will. TreeShift is a microservice that provides HTTP endpoints for:
1. Retrieving all descendant nodes of a given node
2. Change the parent node of a given node
